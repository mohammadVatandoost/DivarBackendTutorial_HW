the Doctor lies.

Nurse: She just
needs to rest.

983
00:45:11,102 --> 00:45:12,935
She'll be
absolutely fine.

984
00:45:12,937 --> 00:45:14,337
The Doctor: No,

985
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:16,739
she won't.

986
00:45:16,741 --> 00:45:21,044
She will be

987
00:45:21,046 --> 00:45:22,478
amazing.

So that's it,
we just leave her there?

00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:43,399
Yeah, but she's
our daughter, Doctor.

She's River

[ Gently ]
Amy, I know,

996
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:50,606
but we have to let her
make her own way now.

997
00:45:50,608 --> 00:45:53,209
We have too much
foreknowledge, it's --

998
00:45:53,211 --> 00:45:58,047
dangerous thing,
foreknowledge.

999
00:45:58,049 --> 00:45:59,048
What's that?

1000
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,149
Nothing,

just some data

from the Teselecta --
very boring.

1003
00:46:04,322 --> 00:46:05,822
Doctor, River was brainwashed
to kill you, right?

1004
00:46:05,824 --> 00:46:07,490
Well, she <i>did</i> kill me
and then she used

1005

her remaining lives
to bring me back.

I'd say that was

But...that stuff that
they put in her head,

is that gone now?

How do people

Oh, Pond,

haven't you figured
that one out yet?

So, then, tell me,

why do you want
to study archaeology?

Well, to be perfectly
honest, Professor,
